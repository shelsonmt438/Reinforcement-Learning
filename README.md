# Reinforcement Learning Projects
## 1.RL-Card Game
### Objective
The goal of this activity is to apply reinforcement learning methods to a simple card game (It’s more like
Blackjack). This exercise is similar to the Blackjack example in Sutton and Barto 5.3 − please note, however, that
the rules of the card game are different and non-standard.


## 2. RL-LunarLander
### Objective
The purpose of this activity is to use and comprehend the Actor Critic reinforcement learning 
approach on the LunarLander  v2 environment from OpenAI Gymnasium. The Actor Critic algorithm 
combines the advantages of value based and policy  based methods by maintaining two separate 
networks: : as a specific policy (actor) and one for the value function (critic) I am aware. Focuses of 
this activity include implementation, training activities, outcomes,
